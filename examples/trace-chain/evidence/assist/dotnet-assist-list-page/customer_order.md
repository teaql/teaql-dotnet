# .NET Assist — List page `Customer Order`

Use the exact generated minimal request. Apply only model-derived filters,
projections and relations, deterministic ID ordering, and the runtime's trusted
10,000-row materialization ceiling. Do not accept raw query JSON or expose a
hard-limit override.

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Generated;
using Generated.Requests;
using TeaQL.Core;
using TeaQL.Runtime;

public static class CustomerOrderListPageService
{
    public static Task<CustomerOrderPage> ListAsync(
        UserContext context, int offset, int limit)
    {
        return Q.CustomerOrdersWithMinimalFields()
            .SelectOrderNumber()
            .SelectDescription()
            .SelectPlatformWith(Q.PlatformsWithMinimalFields())
            .SelectOrderItemList()
            .SelectPaymentList()
            .SelectShipmentList()
            .OrderByIdAscending()
            .Comment("what: load a stable page of Customer Order rows")
            .Purpose("why: serve the authorized bounded Customer Order list")
            .ExecuteForPageAsync(context, offset, limit);
    }
}
```

The returned `CustomerOrderPage` exposes `Rows` (a typed SmartList) and
`TotalCount` (the filtered entity count before offset/limit). Each root row owns
its own mutation ledger; selected children belong to that root's graph.
Use a full-field request instead of a minimal projection before modifying and saving rows.

Compile the source unchanged. Prove exact filtering, projection and relation
selection, stable non-overlapping pages, filtered total count, rejection above
10,000 rows, intent enforcement, and compilation failure for unknown filters or
client-controlled hard-limit APIs.

## TeaQL seven-language assist contract

Apply the verified Rust semantic ceiling while using only the exact DOTNET generated and
runtime APIs. Discover APIs through the generated application AGENTS.md and progressive
model-aware Assist. Do not inspect generated domain-library source.

- Do not create plurals by appending `s` or `es`; use the centralized generated plural.
- Human and non-human entities use different generated predicate vocabularies. Preserve
  forms such as “who are active” and “whose email is”; never infer them from English.
- Configure filters, projection, paging, and other query options before `purpose(...)`.
  Comment may appear anywhere in the chain. Purpose enters the executable stage; execution
  requires both values, but comment does not have to immediately precede purpose.
- Every execute/list/stream and every save accepts exactly one context argument:
  `UserContext`. Name that argument `context`, never `runtime`; data services and global
  policy are injected when the context is built. Reserve `runtime` for process-level
  runtime ownership, provider/pool setup, and module assembly.
- Tenant, merchant, identity, permissions, request policy, purpose policy, hard limit,
  and continuous-page cursor policy come only from trusted context, never dynamic JSON or TFP.
- If the required operation is absent after current entity/action and required field
  Assist, stop that path and report MISSING_ASSIST. Do not guess an API or search the
  generated library as a fallback.
- Create each application-owned source file once. After its first compile attempt,
  repair only the smallest block identified by the exact compiler or test diagnostic.
  Preserve unrelated code; do not rewrite the complete file as an error-recovery loop.
- Before a repair that would replace more than 25% of an existing application file,
  stop and report LARGE_REWRITE_REQUEST with the file, exact diagnostic, reason, and
  estimated scope. Initial creation and model-driven regeneration are not repairs.

Capability: `list-page`.

- Validate offset, page size, filters, deep paths, IN-list size, and sort against
  explicit allow-lists. Reject invalid input instead of widening the query.
- Use a stable unique ordering and retain the runtime hard limit. Continuous-page
  optimization is opt-in, browsing-only, local runtime policy and cannot cross TFP.
- Run count only when explicitly requested; otherwise use the returned list length.
